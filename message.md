The error "Unknown column 'site_experiences.tourist_site_id' in 'WHERE'" persists because your Laravel backend's `TouristSite` model still defines the `experiences` relationship as a `hasMany` relationship, which expects a `tourist_site_id` foreign key in the `site_experiences` table. However, the error indicates this column does not exist, implying `site_experiences` uses a polymorphic relationship (e.g., `experiencable_id` and `experiencable_type`).

To fix this, you **must** modify your Laravel backend:

1.  **Update `app/Models/TouristSite.php`:**
    Change the `experiences` relationship from `hasMany` to `morphMany`:
    ```php
    // In app/Models/TouristSite.php

    use App\Models\SiteExperience;

    public function experiences()
    {
        // CHANGE THIS LINE: from hasMany to morphMany
        return $this->morphMany(SiteExperience::class, 'experiencable');
    }
    ```

2.  **Update `app/Models/SiteExperience.php`:**
    Ensure the `SiteExperience` model has a `morphTo` relationship:
    ```php
    // In app/Models/SiteExperience.php

    public function experiencable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }
    ```

3.  **Verify `site_experiences` table migration:**
    Confirm that your `site_experiences` table migration includes `experiencable_id` and `experiencable_type` columns, typically added like this:
    ```php
    $table->morphs('experiencable');
    ```

These changes are crucial for your Laravel backend to correctly query the `site_experiences` table. I cannot make these changes directly as I am operating within the Flutter project.
